    "This notebook describes the LAB-2 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "* VADER makes use of a sentiment lexicon. Have a look at the lexicon. Be sure to understand which information can be found there (lemma?, wordform?, part-of-speech?, polarity value?, word meaning?)

    "### Sentence 1\n",
    "Sentence 1 produced a label of positive, with it being 0% negative, 19.2% neutral, and 80.8% positive. The reason for this is due to the word \"love\", which has a sentiment rating of 3.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence 2\n",
    "Sentence two has an overall label of negative, with it being 62.7% negative, 37.3% neutral and 0% positive. The reason for this is due to the word \"don't\" in combination with \"love\", which switches the sentiment from positive to negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence 3\n",
    "Sentence 3 has an overall label of positive, with it being 0% negative, 13.3% neutral and 86.7% positive. The sentence is considered to be more positive than sentence 1 due to the fact that it has an emoticon with a sentiment rating of 1.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence 4\n",
    "Sentence 4 produced scores of 50.8% neutral, 49.2% negative, and 0% positive. While the score of neutral is higher than that of negative, the split is very close to equal. The word \"ruins\" has a sentiment rating of -1.9, which makes VADER's output more negative, which results in the overall score of -0.4404. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence 5\n",
    "Sentence 4 produced scores of 0% negative, 51% neutral, and 49% positive, meaning that it is almost equally split between neutral and positive. The words \"certainly not\" negate the negative sentiment of the word \"ruins\", which results in a sentence which is scored as positive rather than negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence 6\n",
    "Sentence 6 is 28.6% negative, 71.4% neutral, and 0% positive. This sentence seems to be incorrectly labeled as negative due to the fact that the word \"lies\" is used, which has a sentiment score of -1.8. The sentence should be labelled as neutral, but due to the fact that \"lies\" can also be used in the context of lying to someone, it is labelled as negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence 7\n",
    "Sentence 7 is 0% negative, 66.7% neutral, and 33.3% positive, with a overall label of positive. This seems to be incorret, as this sentence is using the word \"like\" as a way to compare the house, and that it is not unique. This is done due to the word \"like\", as stated, which has a sentiment rating of 1.5, but considering the context in which it is used, this is incorrect. "

    "VADER picks up the word ‘scared’ and ‘not…bad’ and the subpart ‘not…bad’ has a significant positive impact on the compound rating (as there is the negation of the strongly negative word ‘bad’). This balances the negative words and yields a neutral compound rating.\n",
    "We assessed this by removing that part of the sentence. When doing so the overall compound rating dropped heavily towards a negative rating. \n",
    "No difference when not lemmatizing.\n",

    "When lemmatized is set to true, the word “like” is picked up by VADER. In this context the word “like” is not used in a positive way but as a preposition but VADER doesn’t understand that, thus the sentence is rated positively. When lemmatizing is set to false, additionally the word “hacked” is picked up, making the sentence negative.\n",

Thus, VADER gives a higher compound rating when the sentence is not lemmatized (“better and “tougher” is kept) and rates it positively.  \n",

There are some aspects that have some slight improvements, such as the negative recall and positive f1-score for verbs. Lemmatisation results in the verb being used as its lemma (base form), and this could mean that the meaning of the verb could be modified or lost, which may explain the results. \n",
