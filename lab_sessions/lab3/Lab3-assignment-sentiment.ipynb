    "This notebook describes the LAB-2 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

Be sure to understand which information can be found there (lemma?, wordform?, part-of-speech?, polarity value?, word meaning?)

    "#### Answer:\n",
    "VADER uses a lexicon which consits of word which are sentiment-related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: Here, VADER picks up the word 'love' and rates the sentence positively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: Additionally, VADER picks up the word 'don't' and together with 'love' assigns the sentence negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 3: VADER can also pick up emoticons which it does here and assigns it more positively than without the happy smiley face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 4: VADER picks up the word 'ruins' which has a negative connotations because of the verb 'ruin' while in context 'ruins' is just a state of buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 5: Here, VADER sees the word 'ruins' again but also the word 'not' and so combining them makes it something positive while it should mostly be neutral as it is just a statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 6: Similar to sentence 4, VADER picks up the word 'lies' which has a negative connotation because of the verb 'lying' and thus assigns the sentence a bit negatively. This sentence should only be classified neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 7: Similar to the last sentence, it picks up the word 'like' which has a positive connotation so it assigns the sentence positively but in this context it is just to compare to the other house and should instead be more neutral. "

    "No words are in the VADER lexicon so it classifies it as neutral. We thought ‘phenomenon’ would be rated positive which is why the gold label is positive. \n",
    "No difference when not lemmatizing.\n",

    "**SENTENCE 2:** actually cannot breathe from how wholesome this is, not a single bad thing happens in it & I was real scared for a minute there\n",

    "\n",
    "VADER picks up the word ‘scared’ and ‘not…bad’ and the subpart ‘not…bad’ has a significant positive impact on the compound rating (as there is the negation of the strongly negative word ‘bad’). This balances the negative words and yields a neutral compound rating.\n",
    "We assessed this by removing that part of the sentence. When doing so the overall compound rating dropped heavily towards a negative rating. \n",
    "No difference when not lemmatizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SENTENCE 3:** there are like 4 ppl that hacked into my netflix from different countries so I just left them a message to try and organize a movie night with all of them\n",

    "\n",
    "When lemmatized is set to true, the word “like” is picked up by VADER. In this context the word “like” is not used in a positive way but as a preposition but VADER doesn’t understand that, thus the sentence is rated positively. When lemmatizing is set to false, additionally the word “hacked” is picked up, making the sentence negative.\n",

    "This gold label is neutral as this is an objective sentence from the news. When lemmatized, “better” becomes “well” which has a lower positive rating than “better”. Additionally, “tougher” becomes “tough” which has a negative rating while “tougher” has a positive rating. Thus, VADER gives a higher compound rating when the sentence is not lemmatized (“better and “tougher” is kept) and rates it positively.  \n",

When lemmatized, “manipulated” becomes “manipulate” which is not in the lexicon. “Wanted” becomes “want” which is slightly positive while “wanted” is not in the lexicon.
